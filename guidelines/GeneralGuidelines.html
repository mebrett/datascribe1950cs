<!-- This line for general forms-->
<p>In this form you are transcribing the main area of the census document as well as some of the information from the top of the page.</p>

<!-- This line for sample line forms-->
<p>For this dataset you are transcribing the <strong>sample lines</strong> for the page. Only transcribe those lines which have been indicated as samples on the original census form and therefore have information in the main table as well as the second table near the bottom of the page.</p>

<!-- For both -->
<p>If the cover page for an enumeration district has been included in the dataset, just skip it. You will know the cover page because it will be a tall, narrow document with field counts rather than a table of names.</p>

<p>You must include every field where there is information every time - this means that for a single item you will repeat the information from the top of the page in each record.</p>

<p>Fields in the form have numbers which correspond to the fields on the census document to help with transcribing.</p>
<p>Transcribe each entry as written to the best of your ability. If you have trouble reading a word or phrase, enter your best guess, flag the entry as illegible, and leave a note for the reviewer stating which census fields (by number) you had trouble with.</p>
<p>If the enumarator wrote "not at home" for a line, just skip that line.</p>

<h2>Blank fields</h2>

<p>Different blank fields have different approaches.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enumeration district and required fields cannot be blank. If they are blank, either fill in based on available information (item name) or flag as "is missing".</li>
    <li>Fields 1 and 2 (Street name and house number) should have information, even if the census taker left them blank for members of the same household. Repeat this information for each memebr of the same household, even if the field is blank on the form.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If the street name and house number are blank for row 1 (and subsequent rows) because the household information is carried over from the previous sheet, <em>use the "is missing" flag</em> and leave a note for the reviewer to let them know.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For fields 8-33, do not flag as "is missing" when blank. Just skip that field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding things on the page:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sample lines are distinguished by a bump on the left side of the table.</li> 
<li>The first few rows in the DataScribe form are from the section above the individual entries. These are the a, b, and c questions.</li> 
<li>Street and avenue names area written sideways in the space for Question 1. You may need to rotate the image in order to read them. Note that they can also carry over from page to page. If there is no street name, click over to the Omeka item in a new window and see if the preceding page has a street name.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Box e</h2>
<p>One of the boxes at the top of the page is “e. Hotel, Boarding House, Institution, Military 
Installation, Etc.” Below this heading are places where the enumerator could write the name and type of institution and indicate which lines were included.</p>

<p>If there is information in box e, you will need to transcribe it but only for those lines which fall within the range. For example, in the returns for Fairfax County (30-46), <a href="https://1950census.archives.gov/search/?county=Fairfax&ed=30-46&page=1&state=VA">lines 4 through 30 of page 34</a> were taken at the Peery Inn, a motel. When transcribing lines 4 through 30, you would check “Yes” for “Line falls in range covered by box e” and in the text area you would write “Peery Inn, Motel”</p>
