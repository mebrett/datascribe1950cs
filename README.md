This repository contains supplementary material for a [case study on using DataScribe](https://datascribe.tech/resources/casestudies/#1950-united-states-census) to transcribe selections from the 1950 United States Census. 

Directory contents:

- datascribeForms: json forms which can be edited and can be [imported] into DataScribe

These can be used with the modules [File Sideload](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/filesideload/) and [CSV Import](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/csvimport/) to batch-create items in Omeka S to be used in DataScribe. The images in this directory are from the National Archives and Record Administration's [1950 Census website](https://1950census.archives.gov)
- guidelines: sample guidelines for use with the forms in the datascribeForms directory.
